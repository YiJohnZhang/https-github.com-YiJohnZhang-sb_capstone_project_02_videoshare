contents

title text								# ??? characters
summary text nullable					# < 1024 characters, a blurb spot for a brief summary
default_description text nullable		# 512 characters

# visible								# not implemented, content moderation
####CONTRACTS PORTION STARTS HERE####
status enum								# default 'open', 'standby', 'hype', 'active', 'legacy'
	# not implementing "hype" in the example but the idea is that it is equivalent to a "premiere" and allows a premiere clip to be uploaded if the main content is >3 min (i.e. MV)
	# clicking "publish" sets the status to 'active' is a means so that the disbursement api will query this contract 
	# disbursement api should: first query by active videos; then check video_contract
	# 'legacy' means that the disbursement api will no longer disburse by the contract
	# 'standby' means the contract has been agreed and can upload content; it will be deleted within a set amount of time if left `standby` too long a set time
	# 'open' means the contract has been opened but not signed, it will be deleted within a set time if left 'open' too long

	# parse this into the `contract` array associative (jsonify/stringify)

	# if a user deletes their account that is in the contract_details, figure out to do something with it, but leave it as is for now
contract_signed array nullable			# default: null; there must be more than one user in the `users` array & all users in `users` must be "signed"
date_created date						# here so that an API can search and clean inactive content

date_published date nullable			# here for querying purposes
# aggregate_engagement text nullable	# default: some special formatting that is JSON-like
	# not implemented, not the focus
